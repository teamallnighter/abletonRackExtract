# Railway Authentication Setup Guide

## Security Features for Railway Deployment

### 1. Environment Variables (âœ… Already Implemented)

Railway provides secure environment variable management. We've configured the app to use:

- `JWT_SECRET_KEY` - For signing JWT tokens
- `MONGO_URL` - Automatically provided by Railway when MongoDB is attached

### 2. Setting Up JWT Secret on Railway

1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to the "Variables" tab
4. Add a new variable:
   - Key: `JWT_SECRET_KEY`
   - Value: Generate a secure key using:
     ```bash
     python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
     ```
5. The app will automatically use this key on next deployment

### 3. Additional Security Recommendations

#### A. Use Railway's Built-in Features:

1. **Private Networking**: Railway provides private networking between services
   - MongoDB should only be accessible from your app service
   - No public internet exposure needed

2. **Automatic HTTPS**: Railway provides SSL certificates automatically
   - All traffic is encrypted
   - No additional configuration needed

3. **Rate Limiting**: Consider adding rate limiting to prevent abuse
   ```python
   # Can add to requirements.txt:
   flask-limiter==3.5.0
   ```

#### B. Security Best Practices Implemented:

1. **Password Hashing**: Using bcrypt for secure password storage
2. **JWT Tokens**: Stateless authentication with expiration
3. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated
4. **Secure File Handling**: Using secure_filename for uploads

### 4. MongoDB Security on Railway

Railway's MongoDB addon automatically:
- Creates secure credentials
- Restricts access to your app only
- Provides connection string via environment variables

### 5. Additional Services to Consider

While Railway doesn't have built-in auth services like Auth0, you could:

1. **Add Redis** for session management (Railway has Redis addon)
2. **Use Cloudflare** in front for additional security
3. **Implement 2FA** later for enhanced security

### 6. Monitoring & Logging

Railway provides:
- Built-in logs for debugging
- Metrics for monitoring
- Deployment history

### 7. Current Implementation Status

âœ… Implemented:
- User registration with bcrypt password hashing
- JWT-based authentication
- Protected routes with token validation
- User-rack association
- Environment variable configuration

ðŸ”„ Next Steps:
- Create profile page UI
- Add logout functionality
- Implement "remember me" option
- Add password reset flow

### 8. Testing Authentication

After deployment:

1. Register a new user at `/register`
2. Login at `/login`
3. Access protected routes with JWT token in header:
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
   ```

### 9. Important Notes

- The JWT secret key must be kept secure and never committed to git
- Change the secret key if it's ever exposed
- Consider implementing refresh tokens for better UX
- Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
