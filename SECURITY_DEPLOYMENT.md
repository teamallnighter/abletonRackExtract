# Security Deployment Checklist for Railway

## Steps to Deploy Security Updates

### 1. âœ… Push Code to GitHub (Complete)
- All security updates have been committed and pushed to the main branch

### 2. Configure Railway Environment Variables

Go to your Railway project dashboard and add/update these environment variables:

#### Required Variables:
```bash
# Generate a new JWT secret key
JWT_SECRET_KEY=<generate using: python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))">

# Set allowed origins (replace with your actual Railway domain)
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-app-name.railway.app

# Set Flask to production mode
FLASK_ENV=production
FLASK_DEBUG=False
```

#### MongoDB (Should already be configured by Railway):
- `MONGO_URL` - Automatically provided when MongoDB is attached

### 3. Railway Will Auto-Deploy
- Railway should automatically detect the GitHub push and start deployment
- Monitor the deployment logs for any errors

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification

#### A. Test Security Headers
Visit your site and check the browser console Network tab to verify headers:
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000

#### B. Test Rate Limiting
- Try registering more than 5 times within an hour (should be blocked)
- Try logging in more than 10 times within an hour (should be blocked)

#### C. Test Enhanced Password Validation
Try registering with:
- Short password (< 8 chars) - should fail
- Password without uppercase - should fail
- Password without special characters - should fail
- Common password like "password123" - should fail

#### D. Test Email Validation
- Try registering with invalid email format - should fail
- Try registering with disposable email (e.g., user@tempmail.com) - should fail

### 5. Security Best Practices Moving Forward

1. **Regularly Update Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip list --outdated
   pip install --upgrade [package-name]
   ```

2. **Monitor Logs**
   - Check Railway logs for suspicious activity
   - Look for repeated failed login attempts

3. **Backup Database**
   - Regular MongoDB backups
   - Test restore procedures

4. **Security Audits**
   - Periodically review security headers
   - Test for new vulnerabilities
   - Keep JWT secret key secure and rotate if compromised

### 6. Additional Security Considerations

Consider implementing in future updates:
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- OAuth integration (Google, GitHub login)
- IP-based rate limiting
- Session timeout controls
- Password reset via email
- Account lockout after failed attempts

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check Railway deployment logs
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Ensure MongoDB is properly attached
4. Check for syntax errors in Python files

### If rate limiting doesn't work:
1. Verify Flask-Limiter is installed
2. Check Redis connection (if using Redis backend)
3. Verify the limiter is properly initialized

### If CORS errors occur:
1. Verify ALLOWED_ORIGINS is set correctly
2. Include full protocol (https://) in origins
3. Check for trailing slashes

## Security Incident Response

If a security issue is discovered:
1. Immediately rotate JWT_SECRET_KEY
2. Force all users to re-authenticate
3. Review logs for suspicious activity
4. Patch vulnerability and redeploy
5. Notify affected users if necessary
