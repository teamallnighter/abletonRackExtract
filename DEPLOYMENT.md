# Railway Deployment Guide

## âœ… Ready for Railway Deployment

Your Ableton Rack Analyzer is now configured for Railway deployment with the React frontend integrated.

### What's Been Set Up:

1. **Build Configuration**: 
   - `nixpacks.toml` - Configures Node.js 20 + Python 39
   - `build.sh` - Builds React frontend and copies to Flask static folder
   - `package.json` - Root package.json with build scripts

2. **Flask Backend Updates**:
   - Modified routes to serve React frontend at `/`
   - Client-side routing support for React Router
   - API routes preserved under `/api/*`

3. **Frontend Configuration**:
   - API calls use relative URLs (`/api`) - perfect for same-origin deployment
   - Production build optimized and mobile-responsive

### Deployment Steps:

1. **Push to Railway**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add React frontend for Railway deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Railway will automatically**:
   - Install Node.js 20 and Python 39
   - Install frontend dependencies (`npm ci`)
   - Install backend dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
   - Build React frontend (`npm run build`)
   - Copy built files to Flask static folder
   - Start Flask server with Gunicorn

3. **Access Your App**:
   - Root URL (`/`) â†’ React frontend
   - API endpoints (`/api/*`) â†’ Flask backend
   - All React routes handled by client-side routing

### File Structure After Build:
```
backend/static/frontend/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # React app entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index-*.js      # Main React bundle
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index-*.css     # Styles
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ *.js            # Other chunks
â””â”€â”€ vite.svg           # Favicon
```

### Environment Variables:
Make sure these are set in Railway:
- `PORT` (automatically set by Railway)
- `MONGODB_URI` (if using MongoDB)
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (set to your Railway domain)
- Any other environment variables your Flask app needs

## ðŸš€ You're Ready to Deploy!

Simply push your changes and Railway will handle the rest. The React frontend will be served at the root URL with full mobile responsiveness and all the professional features implemented.
