# One-pager: Ableton Rack Visualizer

## 1. TL;DR
A visual interface upgrade for the Ableton Cookbook that transforms complex rack file analysis into intuitive, professional-looking workflow diagrams. This redesign targets Ableton Live users who need to quickly understand and share rack configurations, replacing the current basic display with a polished visualization system that clearly shows signal flow, device chains, and macro controls.

## 2. Goals
### Business Goals
* Increase user engagement and retention through improved visual experience
* Differentiate from other Ableton tools with superior rack visualization
* Reduce user confusion and support requests through clearer information display
* Enable community sharing and discovery of rack configurations

### User Goals  
* Quickly understand complex rack structures at a glance
* Visualize signal flow and device relationships clearly
* Share rack configurations with professional-looking diagrams
* Discover optimization opportunities in their rack designs

### Non-Goals
* Building a full rack editor or replacing Ableton Live
* Adding audio playback or real-time processing capabilities
* Creating mobile-specific interfaces (focus on desktop first)
* Implementing collaborative editing features

## 3. User stories
**Primary Persona: Producer/Sound Designer**
* "As a producer, I want to see how my rack's signal flows so I can identify bottlenecks and optimize my chain"
* "As a sound designer, I want to share my rack configurations with clients using professional-looking diagrams"

**Secondary Persona: Ableton Educator**  
* "As an instructor, I want to show students complex rack structures in a clear, visual way during tutorials"
* "As a student, I want to analyze professional racks to understand advanced production techniques"

## 4. Functional requirements
### High Priority (P0)
* Interactive flowchart-style rack visualization with nodes and connections
* Clean, modern UI theme replacing current styling
* Device chain visualization with proper hierarchy display
* Macro control mapping visualization
* Responsive layout for different screen sizes

### Medium Priority (P1)
* Hover states and tooltips for detailed device information  
* Zoom and pan functionality for complex racks
* Export visualization as PNG/SVG for sharing
* Color coding for different device types (effects, instruments, utilities)

### Low Priority (P2)
* Animation transitions between rack states
* Customizable visualization themes
* Minimap for navigation in large racks
* Comparison view for multiple racks

## 5. User experience
* **Upload Journey**: User drops .adg/.adv file → sees loading state → receives clean visualization with overview panel
* **Exploration Journey**: User views rack diagram → hovers for details → clicks to focus on specific chains → uses zoom controls for detailed inspection
* **Sharing Journey**: User satisfied with analysis → exports diagram → shares professional visualization with collaborators

### Edge Cases & UI Notes
* Handle racks with 10+ parallel chains gracefully through scrolling/pagination
* Provide fallback text view when visualization becomes too complex
* Show clear error states for corrupted or unsupported rack files
* Maintain performance with large rack files through progressive loading

## 6. Narrative
Sarah, a professional sound designer, receives a complex Ableton rack from a client who wants modifications. Instead of opening Ableton and deciphering the maze of devices manually, she drags the .adv file into the Ableton Cookbook. Within seconds, she sees a beautiful, clear diagram showing exactly how the four parallel chains flow through various effects, where the macro controls connect, and which devices might be causing CPU issues. She quickly identifies that Chain 2 has redundant EQs and takes a screenshot of the visualization to send back to her client with her recommendations. The client is impressed with the professional presentation and immediately approves the optimization work.

## 7. Success metrics
* **User Engagement**: 40% increase in time spent on rack analysis pages
* **Visual Quality**: 90% reduction in user complaints about interface/styling
* **Feature Adoption**: 60% of users utilize zoom/pan functionality within first session
* **Sharing**: 25% increase in rack analysis exports and social sharing
* **User Satisfaction**: Net Promoter Score improvement from current baseline

## 8. Milestones & sequencing
### Phase 1 (4 weeks): Foundation
* New CSS framework implementation and basic styling overhaul
* Core visualization engine with simple node-link diagrams
* Responsive layout system

### Phase 2 (3 weeks): Enhancement  
* Interactive features (hover, zoom, pan)
* Device type categorization and color
