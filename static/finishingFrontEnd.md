# One-pager: Ableton Cookbook React Frontend

## 1. TL;DR
A modern React-based frontend for The Ableton Cookbook, replacing the current vanilla JavaScript/Jinja2 interface with a responsive, component-driven UI. This will provide Ableton Live users with a more polished experience for sharing, discovering, and analyzing audio effect and instrument rack recipes while maintaining all existing functionality.

## 2. Goals
### Business Goals
* Modernize the platform's user interface to improve user retention and engagement
* Establish a scalable frontend architecture for future feature development
* Reduce maintenance overhead by consolidating to a single modern framework
* Improve SEO and performance through better frontend optimization

### User Goals
* Access a faster, more responsive interface for browsing and uploading racks
* Enjoy a modern, intuitive design that matches contemporary web standards
* Experience consistent UI behavior across all devices and screen sizes
* Benefit from improved search and discovery features with better visual feedback

### Non-Goals
* Changing any backend API functionality or database structure
* Modifying the core rack analysis engine or file parsing logic
* Adding new features beyond what exists in the current implementation
* Rewriting authentication or security systems

## 3. User stories
**Producer Paula** needs to quickly find bass synth racks for her deep house track, so she can browse by category and preview rack structures without downloading files.

**Beat Maker Ben** wants to share his custom drum processing chain with the community, so he can upload his .adg file with tags and descriptions through an intuitive interface.

**Sound Designer Sam** analyzes popular racks to learn new techniques, so she can visualize macro mappings and device chains in a clear, interactive format.

## 4. Functional requirements
### High Priority (MVP)
* User authentication (login, register, logout)
* Rack upload with drag-and-drop functionality
* Rack browsing and search with filters
* Individual rack detail view with analysis visualization
* User profile management
* Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### Medium Priority
* Advanced search filters (by device type, tags, popularity)
* Rack favorites and personal collections
* Download tracking and usage statistics
* Real-time search suggestions and autocomplete

### Low Priority
* Dark/light theme toggle
* Keyboard shortcuts for power users
* Advanced rack comparison features
* Social features (following users, commenting)

## 5. User experience
### Core User Journeys
* **Discovery Flow**: Home page → Browse racks → Filter/search → View rack details → Download
* **Upload Flow**: Login → Upload page → Drag/drop file → Add metadata → Publish
* **Profile Flow**: Login → Profile → View uploaded racks → Edit rack details → Manage account

### Edge Cases and UI Notes
* Handle large rack files with loading states and progress indicators
* Graceful error handling for corrupted or invalid .adg/.adv files
* Responsive breakpoints for mobile rack visualization
* Accessibility compliance for screen readers and keyboard navigation
* Offline state handling with appropriate messaging

## 6. Narrative
Sarah opens The Ableton Cookbook on her laptop during a late-night production session. The clean, modern interface loads instantly, displaying a grid of recently uploaded racks with preview thumbnails. She types "reverb send" into the search bar and watches as suggestions appear in real-time. Clicking on a promising result, she's taken to a detailed view where she can see the complete signal chain visualized as an interactive flowchart. The macro mappings are clearly displayed, and with one click, she downloads the rack file directly into her Ableton project folder. The entire experience feels seamless and intuitive—exactly what she needs to keep her creative flow uninterrupted.
